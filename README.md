#Tourism Recommendation System Using Machine Learning 




:

🌍 Tourism Destination Recommendation System
This project is a machine learning-based recommendation system that suggests ideal tourism destinations to users based on their preferences. By using supervised learning techniques, the system learns from historical travel data and user interests to provide accurate, personalized travel recommendations.

🚀 Features
Recommends tourist destinations based on user input (e.g., interests, budget, climate preferences)

Built using Python and scikit-learn

Supports multiple classification algorithms for comparison (e.g., Decision Tree, KNN)

Clean and interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Easy-to-use interface for input and output of recommendations

Dataset preprocessing, training, and evaluation included

🧠 Machine Learning
Supervised learning approach

Feature engineering and data cleaning

Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

Customizable for different regions or datasets

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend/ML: Python, Flask (optional for integration), scikit-learn, pandas

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Version Control: Git + GitHub
